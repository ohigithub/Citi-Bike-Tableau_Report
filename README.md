# Overview

In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Analysis Rubric

Analysis: 
The submitted analysis should include all of the following: 
✓ Analysis on both uncovered phenomena, using the dashboards as a visual guide
✓ Analysis on the chosen city official requested map detailing any noticeable trends
✓ Both write-ups are logically sound
✓ Write-ups are written in a manner that a non-data scientist/analyst could understand

# Findings

In understanding the success of the Citi Bike Program, several phenomena were considered over a three-month period. To ensure this information could be used for public knowledge, all visualizations are made for those with color-blind sensitivity.

First, I evaluated which type of bike was most commonly chosen (classic v. electric) and analyzed how the popularity of both fluctuated throughout different times of day. It was clear that the vast majority (71%) either preferred to ride classic bikes or had classic bikes more readily available to them. From there, I viewed how the trip durations varied per each type of bike to learn if there were differences between how each type of bike was used. The trip duration for electric bikes were only a few minutes longer than that of classic bikes. The trp duration of both bikes both fluctuated at the approximate same rate. (Some days are more popular bike riding days than others.)

Building on that information, I compared the trip duration between casual riders and member riders from each starting point of each station. Across the board, members took shorter trips (every time?) than their casual counterparts. This possibly indicates that the casual riders are using the bikes mainly for liesure or as a last resort rather than members who likely use their bikes more often for regular, brief, commuting. Our map also corroborates how casual riders travel much further and to more places than the member riders.
